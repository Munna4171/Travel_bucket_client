    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
    import App from './App.jsx';
    import './index.css';
    import { store, persistor } from './redux/store.js';
    import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
    import { PersistGate } from 'redux-persist/integration/react';

    // --- ADD THIS LINE ---
    console.log("My VITE_API_URL is:", import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL);
    // --------------------

    ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
      <Provider store={store}>
        <PersistGate loading={null} persistor={persistor}>
          <App />
        </PersistGate>
      </Provider>
    );
    ```

#### Step 2: Push and Redeploy

1.  Save the `main.jsx` file.
2.  Commit and push this change to GitHub:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add debug console log for API URL"
    git push
    ```
3.  Vercel will automatically start a new deployment. Wait for it to finish.

#### Step 3: Check the Live Console

1.  Go to your **live Vercel URL**.
2.  Open the developer console (**Cmd+Opt+J** on Mac, **Ctrl+Shift+J** on Windows).
3.  At the very top of the console, you will see the message from your `console.log`.

### What Does the Console Say?

Now, look at the output. There are only two possibilities, and they will tell us the exact solution.

#### Case 1: It prints `My VITE_API_URL is: undefined`

If you see `undefined`, the problem is **100% in your Vercel settings**.

* **The Fix:** Go back to your Vercel project's **Settings -> Environment Variables**.
    * Make sure the name is *exactly* `VITE_API_URL` (all caps, starts with `VITE_`).
    * Make sure the variable is applied to the **Production** environment. There are checkboxes for Production, Preview, and Development. Make sure **Production** is checked.
    * After you fix it, you must **Redeploy** from the Vercel dashboard.

#### Case 2: It prints `My VITE_API_URL is: https://travel-bucket-backend.onrender.com`

If you see your correct Render URL, it means the variable is set correctly, but there's a typo in the `fetch` call itself.

* **The Fix:** Go back to `SignIn.jsx` and `SignUp.jsx`. Very carefully check the `fetch` line. It must be using backticks `` ` `` and look exactly like this:
    ```javascript
    const res = await fetch(`${API_URL}/api/auth/signup`, { ... });
